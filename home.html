            <p>You awake suddenly and all the memories of a distant past begin to rush into your brain that already feels like it's spliting in 4 halfs. You remember
                friends and enemies along with distant screams of the innocents.
                You have been asleep for countless centuries and the elemental god known before has been lost to the history of time along with the cleansing war and the history and characters that
                saved the word from before from absolute destruction.
                You are now a new god from ancient times. What is your name?

                <p> Well <span class="char-input-name"></span> It's a pleasure to welcome you to your new adventure of power and control</p>
